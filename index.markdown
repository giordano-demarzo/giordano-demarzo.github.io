<div class="section-content">
<p>
I'm a Postdoc at the Political Science Department at the University of Konstanz, and my current research involves studying emergent collective behaviors in societies of Large Language Models such as ChatGPT.
</p>
<p>
Before my employment in Konstanz, I was a doctoral student at Enrico Fermi Research Center, at the Physics department of Sapienza University and at Sapienza School for Advanced Studies. During my PhD, I focused on the modeling of Complex Digital Systems, leveraging numerical simulations, analitical computations and machine learning. I'm also a Junior Research Fellow of the Complexity Science Hub Vienna and consultant for the International Labour Office. I got a MSc in Theoretical Physics and a BSc in Physics from Sapienza University. Additionaly to my background in Physics, I have experience in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Data Analysis.
