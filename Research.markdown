<!-- Short Introductory Paragraph -->
Trained as a physicist, my research can be placed within the landscape of **Complex Systems**, where I delve into phenomena that exhibit emergent properties beyond the sum of their parts. My current focus is on **Large Language Models** (LLMs) and their emergent collective behaviors. I study group phenomena in LLM populated societies and I exploit these Generative AI models to perform **Agent Based Simulations**. An importat part of my research is represented by power laws and scaling laws, as for instance **Heaps' and Zipf's laws**, which are often considered the footprint of Complexity. I'm also interested in **Economic Complexity**, where my approach is based on network theory and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on analyzing the **Job Market** through online job advertisement platforms data. **Neural Networks** are another area of active research, specifically the **Hopfield Model**, one of the most known artificial recurrent neural network. Finally, my investigation extends into **Recommendation Algorithms**, focusing on their impact on online communities and on the emergence of opinion polarization.
