<!-- Short Introductory Paragraph -->
Trained as a physicist, my research can be placed in the landscape of **Complex Systems**, where I delve into phenomena that exhibit emergent properties beyond the sum of their parts. An importat part of my research is represented by power laws and scaling laws, as for instance **Heaps' and Zipf's laws**, which are often considered the footprint of Complexity. I'm also interested in **Economic Complexity**, where my approach is based on network theory and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on analyzing the **Job Market** through online job advertisement platforms data. **Neural Networks** are another area of active research, specifically the **Hopfield Model**, one of the most known artificial recurrent neural network. Finally, my investigation extends into **Complex Digital Systems**, focusing on the impact of recommendation algorithms on online platforms and communities. This includes using **Large Language Models** to simulate these environments, offering a new perspective on digital complexity and **Agent Based Models**.
