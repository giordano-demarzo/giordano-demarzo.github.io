"Steer correction for a remotely operated materials handling vehicle A materials handling vehicle automatically applies a steer correction maneuver if a structure is detected in either a left or right multi-zone steer bumper zone (to the left or right of the vehicle). A controller detects whether a structure is to the side of the materials handling vehicle and automatically determines whether a steer correction maneuver should be to the right or left of the traveling direction of the materials handling vehicle. The materials handling vehicle automatically establishes a hysteresis such that the controller maintains a heading by keeping the structure between the first, outer steer bumper limit and the second, inner steer bumper limit of the left or right multi-zone steer bumper zone. After performing the counter steer maneuver, the vehicle may, for example, resume a substantially straight heading.

"Impingement cooled transition duct A transition duct in an advanced heavy duty gas turbine engine is cooled by impingement jets formed by apertures in a sleeve spaced a distance from the surface to be cooled. The sleeve is configured so as to duct spent impingement air towards the combustor, where it can be subsequently used for mixing with, and combustion of, the fuel, or for cooling of the combustor. The distance between the impingement sleeve and the transition duct surface is varied to control the velocity of air crossflow from spent impingement air in order to minimize the pressure loss due to crossflow. The cross-sectional areas of the apertures are varied to project impingement jets over the various distances and crossflow velocities. Generally, larger aperture areas are used with larger distances. The distance between the impingement sleeve and the transition duct systematically increases towards the combustor as the quantity of spent impingement air increases to a maximum value at the intersection of the combustor and the transition duct. The combination of variations in distance, aperture size, and inter-aperture spacing is utilized to vary the impingement cooling intensity to compensate for the variable internal heat load and also to produce the desired temperature distribution over the surface of the transition duct according to design requirements. The aforementioned variations are optimized to minimize the air flow pressure drop ahead of the combustion system which achieving the required cooling intensity according to design requirements.","F23R3, F01D9, F01D25",1986

This invention more precisely relates to machine mechanisms capable of developing high forces as well as to converters for converting a linear movement into a rotary one and conversely. The loads and displacements between ring-shaped contact members are transmitted by their support surfaces, i.e. their axoids which are capable of rotation about each other. Since friction has been eliminated, these AFMs can be manufactured using highly resistant materials that do not require anti-frictional characteristics. This system reduces the wear of the support surfaces, the energy losses induced by the friction as well as the lubricant consumption. It also increases the force capacities of machines. When compared with traditional lever-type force mechanisms that are hinged using friction or roller bearings, the axoid force mechanism of the present invention has the same size although it is capable of transmitting essentially higher forces.

"System and base station for providing wireless communication system synchronization When insufficient traffic is present in the network to maintain synchronization in this manner, other methods must be used. One approach involves making direct measurements of the timing between base stations (602, 604). This is accomplished in one of two ways. The base may interrupt its transmissions on all sectors for a short interval during which it determines the time of arrival of signals from other base stations (602, 604). Given knowledge of the other base station locations, time errors relative to all other base stations (602, 604) may be derived. Alternatively, the base may send a short signal at high power in the mobile transmit band. This time-of-arrival of this signal is measured by the surrounding base stations and the time errors between pairs of base stations are computed. In some cases, a base station (602, 604) may be isolated sufficiently from all other base stations in the network such that direct base-to-base measurement is not viable. In this case, a fixed mobile (606) is placed at a location in the handoff region between the isolated cell and another cell in the network.

"Method and system for improving smoothness of upshifts in an automatic transmission To reduce shift bump and increase smoothness during upshifts, pressure into an on-coming clutch of an automatic transmission is electronically controlled using a turbine speed adaptive strategy. Because of the change in engine speed that accompanies this torque flow path transition, such upshifts include a torque phase and an inertia phase. To make the shift smooth, the torque phase is completed quickly by boosting pressure at the beginning of the upshift. Just before the torque phase is completed, the pressure is lowered so the inertia phase bump is reduced. The end of the torque phase is predicted by monitoring the turbine speed rise since the start of the shift and comparing it with a value which is derived from an adaptive table. During the inertia phase, the pressure is ramped up to complete the shift quickly and smoothly. Ignition spark timing is reduced in the inertia phase to further improve shift feel.",F16H61,1992

"Process and arrangement for encoding video pictures Today's video codecs require the intelligent choice between many coding options. This choice can efficiently be done using Lagrangian coder control. But Lagrangian coder control only provides results given a particular Lagrange parameter, which correspond to some unknown transmission rate. On the other hand, rate control algorithms provide coding results at a given bitrate but without the optimization performance of Langrangian coder control.The combination of rate control and Lagrangian optimization for hybrid video coding is investigated. A new approach is suggested to incorporate these two known methods into the video coder control using macroblock mode decision and quantizer adaptation. The rate-distortion performance of the proposed approach is validated and analyzed via experimental results. It is shown that for most bit-rates the combined rate control and Lagrangian optimization producing a constant number of bits per picture achieves similar rate distortion performance as the constant slope case only using Lagrangian optimization.",H04N7,2005
