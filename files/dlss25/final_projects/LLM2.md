# Project Title: Mapping Cultural Evolution Through Song Lyrics

## Project Description

This project fine-tunes BERT or similar models to create embedding spaces where songs cluster by lyrical themes, tracking how artists move through "cultural space" over time to study influences on musical expression. For similar studies, refer to:

## Project Steps

### Part 1: Data Collection and Preliminary Analysis (10 points)

#### Data Collection
- Collect song lyrics using Genius API, Billboard chart data, and artist discographies with release dates.
- Obtain economic indicators timeline and social movement dates for contextual analysis.

#### Data Cleaning
- Clean datasets by removing duplicates, standardizing artist names, and filtering relevant lyrical content.
- Implement preprocessing including lyric normalization and temporal alignment.

#### Preliminary Data Analysis and Visualization
- Analyze lyrical theme distributions and temporal evolution patterns.
- Visualize cultural trends using theme clustering and artist trajectory analysis.

### Part 2: Deep Learning Model (10 points)

#### Fine-tune BERT Model
- Fine-tune BERT or similar models using PyTorch for lyrical theme embedding with contrastive learning approaches.
- Provide detailed, well-commented code available in a repository linked in the report.

#### Model Training and Validation
- Train embeddings optimized for thematic clustering and temporal consistency.
- Validate through theme coherence metrics and artist trajectory analysis.

#### Deployment and Testing
- Test embedding quality through cultural theme identification and artist evolution tracking.
- Analyze correlation between cultural movements and lyrical theme shifts.

### Part 3: Cultural Studies Analysis (10 points)

#### Analysis Using the Embedding Model
- Analyze cultural evolution patterns and their relationship to social and economic factors.
- Evaluate insights into musical expression and cultural change dynamics.

#### Presentation and Report
- Summarize findings regarding cultural evolution in musical expression.
- Discuss applications for digital humanities and cultural analytics.
